  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I currently live in Marietta, GA and have been here for 12 years. I moved to the Atlanta area to pursue a music
    career and very quickly realized that it was not for me. Instead of becoming an entertainer, I did however stay
    in the business and have been working for a chain of music stores around the area as an assistant warehouse manager.
  </p>
  <p>
    I realized that my time and ability to do anything useful with my life there was short and unfulfilled and about a
    year ago I started to learn to code on my own.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have always had an interest with web development. Earlier in life around age 14 or so I had already been messing
    around with HTML and creating geocities websites on Yahoo.
  </p>

  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Become a great software/web developer</li>
    <li>Be successful at being a developer</li>
    <li>Be happy in life</li>
    <li>Live in the moment and enjoy all of it</li>
  </ul>
